[PROBLEM]: No survival goal detected. Need better scene understanding or fallback logic.
[SOLUTION]: To improve scene understanding and add fallback logic for the "no survival goal detected" issue, you can implement the following:

**1. Entity Tracking**

Create a system that tracks all entities on the map, including players, mobs, and items. This will allow your AI to detect potential threats or opportunities.

```java
// EntityTracker.java

public class EntityTracker {
    private HashMap<Integer, Entity> trackedEntities;

    public EntityTracker() {
        this.trackedEntities = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void trackEntity(Entity entity) {
        trackedEntities.put(entity.getId(), entity);
    }

    public boolean isPlayerNearby(Player player, int distance) {
        for (Entity entity : trackedEntities.values()) {
            if (entity instanceof Player && entity != player && isWithinRange(player, entity, distance)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean isWithinRange(Entity player, Entity entity, int range) {
        // Calculate the distance between the two entities
        double distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(entity.getX() - player.getX(), 2) + Math.pow(entity.getZ() - player.getZ(), 2));
        return distance <= range;
    }
}
```

**2. Fallback Logic**

Implement a fallback logic that generates a random survival goal if none is detected. This could be something like "gather resources," "build shelter," or "defend against mobs."

```java
// SurvivalGoalGenerator.java

public class SurvivalGoalGenerator {
    private Random random;

    public SurvivalGoalGenerator() {
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public SurvivalGoal generateRandomGoal() {
        int goalType = random.nextInt(3); // 0: gather resources, 1: build shelter, 2: defend against mobs
        switch (goalType) {
            case 0:
                return SurvivalGoal.GATHER_RESOURCES;
            case 1:
                return SurvivalGoal.BUILD_SHELTER;
            case 2:
                return SurvivalGoal.DEFEND_AGAINST_MOBS;
            default:
                return null; // or throw an exception
        }
    }
}
```

**3. Goal Detection**

Create a system that detects the player's current goal based on their actions and surroundings.

```java
// GoalDetector.java

public class GoalDetector {
    private Player player;
    private EntityTracker entityTracker;

    public GoalDetector(Player player, EntityTracker entityTracker) {
        this.player = player;
        this.entityTracker = entityTracker;
    }

    public SurvivalGoal detectGoal() {
        // Check if the player is gathering resources
        if (isGatheringResources()) {
            return SurvivalGoal.GATHER_RESOURCES;
        }
        // Check if the player is building shelter
        else if (isBuildingShelter()) {
            return SurvivalGoal.BUILD_SHELTER;
        }
        // Check if the player is defending against mobs
        else if (isDefendingAgainstMobs()) {
            return SurvivalGoal.DEFEND_AGAINST_MOBS;
        }
        // If none of the above conditions are met, generate a random goal
        else {
            return new SurvivalGoalGenerator().generateRandomGoal();
        }
    }

    private boolean isGatheringResources() {
        // Check if the player is near a resource node or has resources in their inventory
    }

    private boolean isBuildingShelter() {
        // Check if the player is building a structure or has materials to build a shelter
    }

    private boolean isDefendingAgainstMobs() {
        // Check if there are mobs nearby and the player is defending against them
    }
}
```

**4. Goal-Based Decision Making**

Create a system that uses the detected goal to make decisions for the player.

```java
// GoalBasedDecisionMaker.java

public class GoalBasedDecisionMaker {
    private Player player;
    private GoalDetector goalDetector;

    public GoalBasedDecisionMaker(Player player, GoalDetector goalDetector) {
        this.player = player;
        this.goalDetector = goalDetector;
    }

    public void makeDecision() {
        SurvivalGoal goal = goalDetector.detectGoal();
        switch (goal) {
            case GATHER_RESOURCES:
                gatherResources();
                break;
            case BUILD_SHELTER:
                buildShelter();
                break;
            case DEFEND_AGAINST_MOBS:
                defendAgainstMobs();
                break;
            default:
                // Handle unknown goals
        }
    }

    private void gatherResources() {
        // Make the player gather resources based on their goal
    }

    private void buildShelter() {
        // Make the player build a shelter based on their goal
    }

    private void defendAgainstMobs() {
        // Make the player defend against mobs based on their goal
    }
}
```

    }

    public boolean isPlayerNearby(Player player, int distance) {
        for (Entity entity : trackedEntities.values()) {
            if (entity instanceof Player && entity != player && isWithinRange(player, entity, distance)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean isWithinRange(Entity player, Entity entity, int range) {
        // Calculate the distance between the two entities

        return distance <= range;
    }
}

    public ResourceGatherer(Player player, EntityTracker entityTracker) {
        this.player = player;
        this.entityTracker = entityTracker;
    }

    public boolean hasResourcesAndNearResourceNode() {
        // Check if the player has resources in their inventory
        if (player.getInventory().contains(ResourceType.CRAFTING_TABLE)) {
            // Check if there is a resource node nearby
            return entityTracker.isPlayerNearby(player, 10); // adjust distance as needed
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

```java
// ShelterDetector.java

public class ShelterDetector {
    private Player player;

    public ShelterDetector(Player player) {
        this.player = player;
    }

    public boolean hasShelter() {
        // Check if the player has built a structure with doors and windows
        return player.getInventory().contains(ResourceType.DOOR) && player.getInventory().contains(ResourceType.WINDOW);
    }
}
```

// MobDetector.java

public class MobDetector {
    private EntityTracker entityTracker;

    public MobDetector(EntityTracker entityTracker) {
        this.entityTracker = entityTracker;
    }

    public boolean hasMobsNearby() {

    }
}
```

        }
        // Check if the player has built a shelter or needs to build one
        else if (!shelterDetector.hasShelter()) {
            return SurvivalGoal.BUILD_SHELTER;
        }

        return false; // adjust threshold as needed
    }
}
```

**2. Add a Noise System**

Implement a noise system that detects if there is noise coming from nearby.

```java

```

**5. Add Fallback Logic**

Add fallback logic to handle situations where the goal detector cannot detect a goal.

```java
// GoalDetector.java

public class GoalDetector {

        return SurvivalGoal.GENERATE_RANDOM_GOAL;
    }
}
```

```java
// GoalBasedDecisionMaker.java

public class GoalBasedDecisionMaker {
    // ...

    public void makeDecision() {
        SurvivalGoal goal = goalDetector.detectGoal();
        if (goal == null) {
            goal = goalDetector.getFallbackGoal();
        }
        switch (goal) {
            case FIND_LIGHT_SOURCE:
                findLightSource();
                break;
            case INVESTIGATE_NOISE:
                investigateNoise();
                break;
            default:
                // Handle unknown goals
        }
    }
}
```

By implementing these systems and adding fallback logic, you can improve scene understanding and handle situations where the goal detector cannot detect a goal.

[PROBLEM]: No survival goal detected. Need better scene understanding or fallback logic.
[SOLUTION]: To improve scene understanding and add fallback logic for the "no survival goal detected" issue, you can implement the following:

public class BiomeDetector {
    private Player player;

    public BiomeDetector(Player player) {
        this.player = player;
    }

    public Biome getBiome() {
        // Check the biome based on the player's position and surrounding blocks
        return new BiomeFinder().findBiome(player.getPosition());
    }
}
```

        this.player = player;
    }

    public boolean hasResourcesAvailable() {

        return new ResourceFinder().findResources(player.getPosition());
    }
}
```

**5. Update the Goal Detector**

Update the goal detector to use the new system.

        this.resourceAvailabilitySystem = resourceAvailabilitySystem;
    }

    public SurvivalGoal detectGoal() {
        // Check the biome and set a goal accordingly
        switch (biomeDetector.getBiome()) {
            case JUNGLE:
