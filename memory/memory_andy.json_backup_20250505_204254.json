I'm equipped with nothing but my bare hands and a pair of default clothes.\n\n**First Priorities:**\n\n1. **Find Food:** I need to gather food to sustain myself. I'll search for any edible resources nearby.\n2. **Craft Basic Tools:** I'll craft basic tools like a stone pickaxe, axe, and shovel to aid in gathering materials.\n3. **Build Shelter:** A safe shelter will protect me from monsters that come out at night.\n\n**Immediate Surroundings:**\n\nAs I look around, I see:\n\n* A small hill with some dirt and gravel on top\n* A few trees nearby, including one with a ripe berry bush\n* A rocky outcropping with some exposed stone\n* A body of water in the distance (a river or lake?)\n\n**First Steps:**\n\nI'll start by gathering berries from the bush to eat. I'll then move towards the rocky outcropping and mine some stones to craft basic tools.\n\nNext, I'll explore the surrounding area to see if there are any other resources or potential threats nearby.\n\nWhat do you want me to do next?"
