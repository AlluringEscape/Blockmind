Note that this script assumes you have pyautogui and OpenCV installed (`pip install pyautogui opencv-python`). Also, make sure to adjust the region in `pyautogui.screenshot` as needed to capture your Minecraft window.


```python
import pyautogui
import time
import keyboard

def explore():
    # Wait for the game to be focused
    while True:
        if pyautogui.pixelMatchesColor(0, 0, (255, 255, 255)):
            break
        else:
            continue
    
    # Set movement speed to fast
    pyautogui.keyDown('shift')

    # Explore in a square shape for 10 blocks by 10 blocks area
    for i in range(-5, 6):
        for j in range(-5, 6):
            # Move the character to the new location
            pyautogui.moveTo(0 + (i * 19), 0 + (j * 19))
            
            # Wait a bit for the game to update
            time.sleep(1)
            
            # Press and release the jump key
            pyautogui.press('space')
            pyautogui.release('space')

            # Check if we hit any blocks
            while True:
                if keyboard.is_pressed('f3'):  # If 'f3' is pressed, stop exploring
                    return
                elif not pyautogui.pixelMatchesColor(0, 0, (255, 255, 255)):  # If the screen turns dark
                    break
